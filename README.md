# Hospital Readmission Prediction

## Purpose
Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days after hospital discharge.

## Data
The original dataset was provided in Excel format and converted to CSV for easier data preprocessing and analysis.

## Notebooks
1. **1_EDA.ipynb** — Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on numerical, categorical, and text columns.  
2. **2_modeling.ipynb** — Trains and evaluates Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models, and compares their performance.
3. **3_extract_note.ipynb** — Experiments with different methods for extracting information from the discharge_note column.  

## Report
A brief summary of methods, results, and findings is provided in **report.md**.
